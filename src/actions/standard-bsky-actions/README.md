# Standard Actions

Actions are the set of operations that are executed in response to certain validation or criteria fulfillment. This could range from sending reply posts, logging particular information, or executing any function, to more complex sequences of operations. You even have the ability to create custom actions based on your needs.

These are standardized actions that make them easy to use from any subscriber or handler.
